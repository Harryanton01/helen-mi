      <br>
thank you for your enquiry.  we note your feelings of despair.  whilst we were sorry to hear that you were deeply disappointed at the outcome we  hasten to remind you that participation was consensual and, as such, the verdict binding, both emotionally and in fact.  our clients occupy similar emotional terrain and it is neither acceptable nor appropriate  to raise as a bar to trade the sensual constraints that so notably apply.  your client was clearly at fault in considering herself equipped to participate in matters beyond her understanding and must now suffer the consequences.  in failing to have sufficient insight into her own limitations and lack of emotional intelligence she, and (as a direct result) we, find ourselves even less aligned with the deeper level structures of the universe.  in any event we see no sense in making grand statements at this stage save to say that all trips to your client’s kitchen will be postponed;  it is after all a very long way to travel and though our client has never once, to her credit, claimed re-imbursement, the emotional expenditure is proving far too costly. 
as the site of crisis is now shifting away from the anus we shall take this opportunity to retreat and enjoy, or at least experience mindfully, the looseness this shift brings.   this will make us better equipped to assist in resisting other pockets of tension as and when they appear.  we trust that this is acceptable.

thank you for your enquiry. whilst it does not fall squarely within the remit of our function to  advise on matters relating to the neurological, the bind in which you find yourself does bring to mind a situation which, if recounted, might assist.
on 13 April 2009 an ant met a centipede walking along the same stretch of moss lined bark.  “HOW DO YOU CO-ORDINATE ALL THOSE LEGS?” enquired the ant, marvelling at the centipede’s effortless grace.  “I HAVE ENOUGH TROUBLE COPING WIV SIX!” the ant grumbled.  
the centipede thought it over for a moment, and  never moved again.

we sincerely hope that this assists, though we suspect it might not.

ADVICE 3
<br>
before we respond to your enquiry we wish to make clear, for the avoidance of  doubt, that in offering this facility we do not consider ourselves bound at any level  to provide a response to enquiries on demand.  there having been, to our knowledge, no passing consideration (in money or money’s worth), our facility should not be construed as an offer  as such but, rather, as an invitation to the world at large.  Consequently, the burden rests with you to initiate negotiations and to make an offer directly to us in response to our invitation to treat. we shall construe your enquiry as precisely that (a directed offer)  and it is accordingly now incumbent upon us to decide whether to accept or reject your offer. this we shall now do, if you could just bear with us a moment………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
notwithstanding that in our view, as previously made clear though we repeat in the interests of good order, we are not obligated to accept,we, on this occasion, are delighted to accept your offer to advise,  and hereby state in response to your enquiry the following: 
as far as we are aware, some French former colonies still pay reparations to France for their independence.
please treat this as formal notice that we will not be held responsible for any loss occasioned by reliance on the advice given above.

ADVICE 4
<br>
thank you for your enquiry.
whilst we would, ordinarily, be the first to congratulate you on your escape from an employment which does not accord with your earthly nature, the manner of your departure, the  gross mismanagement of your employer’s  sensorial schema  and your conduct generally have together resulted in your now being subject to circumstances over which you have little (or no) control or understanding. it seems to us that whilst agreeing to provide personal training services to our client you did not make sufficiently clear from the outset precisely what you intended to train and how personal you intended to make it. 

it is not acceptable that you should seek to defend your conduct by misquoting Wittgenstein. whether a thing is spoken or not cannot be a sensible or proper indicator of whether or not it is known. If she doesn’t know then she cannot speak; conversely if she does know then she can either speak or not speak.  

we do of course accept and acknowledge that there has been a level of service provided and from which our client has benefited in terms of her own personal growth.  in recognition of that service we will not be reporting you to the tribunal or seeking a refund of the monies hereto allocated to the purported training sessions.  that said, our client would like returned to her all her saliva, together with an acknowledgment of the monies loaned and an admission of desire, however redundant you consider that to be.

ADVICE 5
<br>
relationship failures are common, but whilst we applaud you on your attempts to sever dealings, you have failed to observe any of the procedures necessary such as would have enabled him to secure adequate recompense and this will inevitably, and regrettably, render him weak and effectively impotent.  he is brave, it seems; extraordinarily brave; and will not be bullied, we suspect, into liking emotion or fruit. 


<br>

ADVICE 6
<br>
thank you for your enquiry.

we should make clear at the outset, that the function of the thirteenth fairy is not to negate or render void the curse applied by the twelfth, but to moderate its effects.  there is incumbent upon you, as you are surely by now  aware, a common law duty to mitigate your loss and, notwithstanding the notional damage caused to you by your friend’s alleged infidelity, we cannot see anything in your behaviour that can be seen to  constitute mitigation. it is wholly unacceptable to evade blame in its entirety and you should be in no doubt whatsoever that your “back arched, feed me belly foremost” stance will do nothing to shift this duty.  the air has always been thick with alsations and stinging nettles and in not taking the necessary precautions you have contributed to the misdeed, at least in part.  thankfully the circumstances, whilst regrettable, do provide a window of opportunity for reflection and, perhaps, an enhanced understanding of the complexities of desire.

ADVICE 7
<br>
we take issue with the allegations contained in your enquiry and demand either that they be substantiated with documentary evidence or that they be immediately withdrawn. witness testimony will not be admissable unless you can demonstrate that the proposed witness is not indebted to you in any way, emotionally or otherwise.
if neither proof nor retraction are forthcoming by close of event this evening we shall forward to you a detailed account of the damaged caused to us by your spurious remarks.  such account will of course include a claim for the associated costs of  our increased appetite and ensuing larger frame.

ADVICE 8
<br>
thank you for your enquiry.  I will address the matters raised in the order in which they appear, adopting your numbering for ease of reference. 

1.the advice should have been sought as soon as you became aware that the girl in the cheap summer dress had died. 
2.had we known the severity of the repression and the deep and permanent damage that would ensue, we would never have put forward repression as the preferred option. It was believed at the time that alongside the already present statutory affection would exist a kind of sensory empathy, an environment in which she might well have become happy.  it now seems, however, that 44 years of uncertainty and worry have been endured needlessly.  that said, it should not be overlooked that the journey itself has yielded fruit that might otherwise not have been available to her had the trauma been avoided. 
3. as indicated in our response to number 2.as set out above, with the benefit of hindsight we concede that we should perhaps have advised at the appropriate time that the pain of abandonment, whilst severe, is often preferable to the effects of repression, which tend to endure and are  often more uncertain and far-reaching.  There is, nevertheless, a good possibility that the abandonment will not have been repressed completely. Indeed, if emotions do surface we ask that you  contact us without delay and using the special code that we will now transmit to you by sms in readiness.  furthermore we urge you to do your utmost to limit the gratitude you feel towards us, at least for the time being, as any new emotion experienced might interfere with the attempted surfacing of the formerly repressed sentiments. 
4. we were, earlier today in fact, contacted by the deceased’s personal representatives.  they said that they could not see any advantage to themselves in honouring the agreement made by the deceased. They went on to say, somewhat unnecessarily to our mind, that, as it was not their  honour  at stake, they could not give a flying fuck.`],
